# Type To Survive
I created this JS game with the intention to help people improve their typing speed, but also give an opportunity to test their words per minute on keyboard or mobile.

This application is part of a bigger website I have created with a MySQL database. However, this individual project was large enough to acquire its own repository.
The website it is part of is: foxdrop.me
